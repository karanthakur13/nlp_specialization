# NLP Specialization Task: Comedy Transcript Generation

This project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate comedy transcripts. The pipeline involves web scraping transcripts of comedians, performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), conducting sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and finally generating comedy transcripts using generated language.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to leverage NLP techniques to generate comedy transcripts. The pipeline involves several steps to process the data and extract meaningful insights. The process can be summarized as follows:

1. **Web Scraping**: Collecting comedy transcripts from various online sources using web scraping techniques.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the collected transcripts by removing noise, special characters, and irrelevant content.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing and visualizing the cleaned data to gain insights into the distribution, patterns, and characteristics of the comedy transcripts.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment expressed in the comedy transcripts, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral, to understand the overall tone.
5. **Topic Modeling**: Identifying the underlying topics or themes in the comedy transcripts using topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).
6. **Generated Language**: Utilizing the generated language models to generate new comedy transcripts that capture the style and humor of the original comedians.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Gensim


## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Ensure that all the required dependencies are installed (see [Installation](#installation)).
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `comedy_transcript_generation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute each step of the pipeline.
5. Modify the notebook according to your specific requirements and dataset if desired.
6. Run the notebook cells one by one to generate comedy transcripts using the provided techniques.

## Pipeline

The project pipeline consists of the following major steps:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collecting comedy transcripts through web scraping techniques or using pre-existing datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Preprocessing the collected data by removing irrelevant information, special characters, and other noise.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the cleaned data to understand its structure, word distributions, and any patterns or insights that can be gained.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment expressed in the comedy transcripts, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral, using pre-trained sentiment analysis models or custom models.
5. **Topic Modeling**: Applying topic modeling techniques to identify the underlying topics in the comedy transcripts.
6. **Generated Language**: Using language generation models (such as GPT-3) to generate new comedy transcripts based on the learned patterns and styles from the original data.
